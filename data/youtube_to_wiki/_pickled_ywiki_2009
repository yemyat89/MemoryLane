V"Poker Face" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her debut album, The Fame (2008). Produced by RedOne, it was released as the album's second single in late 2008 for some markets and in early 2009 for the rest of the world. "Poker Face" is an uptempo synthpop song in the key of A\u266d minor, following in the footsteps of her previous single "Just Dance", but with a darker musical tone. The main idea behind the song is bisexuality and was a tribute by Gaga to her rock and roll boyfriends. Lyrically, the track is about a woman engaged in the practice of cockteasing.
