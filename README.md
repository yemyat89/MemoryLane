#MemoryLane App

While learning Youtube iframe API, I created this as a learning exercise. The app allows you to listen musics from a selected year in a playlist. It parses billboard and other sources to get top 100 musics of last 50 years and query these songs to Youtube API. The same applies to movies trailer. The source comes from imdb.com.

Technologies used are 
* Angular
* Flask
* BeautiulSoup
* OAuth
* etc.

First iteration of original idea can be seen here http://wdml.herokuapp.com. Once you choose a year, it shows a list of musics and movie (trailers) released that year. You can individually play each clips or can play all by playing them in a PlayList. The list is created dynamically when requested.
